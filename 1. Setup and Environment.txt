1. Setup and Environment:

Set up a shared GitHub repository for code collaboration.
Ensure everyone has access to the Google Doc for project documentation.
Confirm the required libraries and tools (OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, YOLO).

2. Data Preparation:

Collect and prepare a dataset for training YOLO (e.g., a sprite sheet or custom video footage).
Annotate the dataset with bounding boxes and class labels if not already done.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. YOLO Integration:


Implement YOLO for object detection.
Train YOLO on the prepared dataset.
Test YOLO to ensure accurate object detection.

4. Data Generator:

Develop a Python class (DataGenerator) to handle video frames and extract object data.
Initialize with video_path.
Implement next() method to return:
Object Class
Bounding Box Width (BoxW)
Bounding Box Height (BoxH)
Bounding Box Center (BoxCenter)
Decide if the generator should label objects consistently across frames or leave that to the RL agent.

5. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:

Design the RL model architecture.
Define the reward function for accurate trajectory prediction.
Implement the RL agent to process data from the DataGenerator.
Train the RL agent using the YOLO output.
Evaluate and refine the RL agentâ€™s performance.

6. Integration and Testing:

Integrate YOLO with the RL agent.
Test the combined system on various videos to predict object trajectories.
Fine-tune the system for better accuracy and performance.

7. Documentation and Reporting:

Document the code and processes thoroughly.
Prepare a project report detailing the methodology, implementation, and results.
Create a presentation for the final project demonstration.

8. Additional Tasks:

Review and incorporate any feedback from Anthony.
Assign specific roles and tasks to each team member to ensure balanced workload.
Schedule regular meetings to track progress and address any issues.
